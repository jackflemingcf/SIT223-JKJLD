    <p class = "aboutus">
        As you all know lockdown was hard on everybody but the group of people who were most vulnerable were international students. <br><br>

        There are a lot of international students who come from low income families and were supporting themselves by doing casual work. Due to lockdown, a lot of business were shut down and it resulted in loss of jobs which affected international students the most, as there was no support provided by the Goverment.

        There was a huge number of international students that became food insecure and were not able to buy groceries. The saving grace for international students were charity and volunteer organisations, which worked hard to provide meals and groceries to affected students. <br><br>

        Support for International Students is a platform created to bring together information of charity and volunteer organisations that are offering food, groceries or any kind of help to international students.
